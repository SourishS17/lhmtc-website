				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<div class="about-content-wrapper">
					<p>Founded in February 2001 as the 'Lavender Hill Mob Drama Club', we later decided that, because we offered more than just drama, it was necessary to rebrand ourselves as the 'Lavender Hill Mob Theatre Company'. As a team we are highly committed to providing an outstanding service to the community and all involved within the Company.</p>
					<h3>The Beginning</h3>
					<p>Founder Les Miles was a member of the <a href="https://www.chickenshed.org.uk/" target="_blank">Chicken Shed Theatre Company</a> in North London, where she achieved a BTEC National Diploma in Performing Arts. Having three years' experience and gaining many qualifications as a Learning Support Assistant, and ten years as a qualified registered Child Minder, she brings her own and part of the Chicken Shed's ethos - everyone is included. In 2002, Tim Rock joined as Musical Director. Tim is a qualified teacher, gaining a first-class honours degree in Music, along with a PGCE in Secondary Education. He's been a professional musician and teacher for over 20 years.<br><br>Over the years, we have built up a solid reputation for quality and integrity. This can only be achieved and maintained by the qualified and committed volunteers we have at LHMTC. Some of whom (along with our Artistic Director) have also achieved qualifications and invaluable experience at the Chicken Shed Theatre Company.</p>
					<h3>Inclusion: How LHMTC Works</h3>
					<p>We are an <i>inclusive</i> theatre company. This means that <span class="emphasis">everyone is welcome no matter their ability</span>, and <span class="emphasis">no audition is necessary</span>. Everyone is respected, valued, and encouraged to take part - no matter how small their contribution is.<br><br>Most of our material is original, giving everyone a chance to pursue their own talents or to develop skills that some didn't think they had. Some of our members choose not to act, dance, or sing, but instead take an interest in the more technical side of the Theatre, which can be as equally challenging as performing on the stage. You don't need to be an actor to act, a singer to sing, or a dancer to dance!<br><br>Each member of the group respects one another and is taught that everyone has a gift of some sort. All our performances include sign language (BSL) where appropriate. Moreover, our older members are encouraged to do extra training, such as first aid or learning sign language, in order to teach the younger members. Our members are split up into groups. Each group has Team Leaders to assist the Directors and help encourage the more challenging members, stimulating the learning environment.<br><br>There are three fundamental rules of the LHMTC, which form the basis of all our members:</p>
					<h2 class="big">RESPECT - ENCOURAGEMENT - COMMITMENT</h2>
					<h2 class="small" style="padding-top: 1rem;">RESPECT</h2>
					<h2 class="small">ENCOURAGEMENT</h2>
					<h2 class="small" style="padding-bottom: 1rem;">COMMITMENT</h2>
					<p>Many members who take safe and enjoyment time with us (some of whom have learning/behavioural issues) are found to be shy and withdrawn, but joining in brings out the best in them. The LHMTC gives the opportunity to assist and support them, developing their social skills. Each member is encouraged to do the best they can, and no-one is pressured into doing something they do not wish to do. Our members look forward to the weekly workshops and, depending on their age, can also attend other evenings where they can write their own short plays/scripts and learn all aspects of theatre, including the <a href="https://www.voicemaster-international.com/" target="_blank">Hudson Voice Technique</a>.<br><br>Indeed, we are very pro-active in encouraging our members to contribute to our shows. For example, our original scripts (for Pantomines, as well as more serious performances) rather than being 'set in stone' from the beginning, are very 'organic' with members being encouraged to experiment and develop ideas which adds to the family atmosphere, the cohesive nature of the group, and makes the learning process for shows so much more enjoyable!</p>

								<p>Just a note to say what an amazing group you are. Watching you this afternoon at Wymondham brought tears to my eyes. It is close to my heart as my life, other than my family. The women's section is working with these special kids as I've now worked with them in my present job here for 24 years.<br><br>The youngsters are brilliant and their signl anguage is much better than mine! WELL DONE TO YOU ALL!<br><br>Hope to see you again sometime in the near future,</p>

								<p>Just a note to say thank you for yesterday's performance by the Lavender Hill Mob at the British Legion Women's Section anniversary concert. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and as the standing ovation proved, so did the rest of the audience. The smile has still not left my face!</p>

								<p>I was at Circus Chermond's kaleidoscope show at the hippodrome on Saturday.<br><br>I wanted to commend your group's performance. The third musical item in particular was very moving. The group really added to the show. The inclusive nature of your group demonstrated the abilities of all individuals. Well done!<br><br>Kind regards,</p>

								<p>Just to say how much we enjoyed Dick Whittington and were thrilled to see Claire so involved in the performance. It was very funny, I love corny jokes and there were plenty of those. The songs were very moving and gave a great impression of the 'community' you have created. The costumes are brilliant and we loved Claire's dres sagain although I think she was casting an eye on the wedding dresses! You all do such a fantastic job to get everyone to do their 'bit' and we do appreciate how had that is. It's awful to think if Plaxtole closes, Claire won't be able to go to Lavender Hill because it means that she will not have access to a threatre company that addresses the needs of people with LD and enables them to fulfil their dreams of being actors and actresses. Many, many thanks to you all, we had a great time on Sunday.</p>

								<p>This is just a short note to tell you and all the members of the Lavender Hill Mob Theatre Company how our audience enjoyed the wonderful show at Brundall on 17th March. It was inspirational. It was such a happy atmosphere nobody could fail to have a good time. Many of our audience are elderly and love this type of music. One lady said she enjoyed every minute of it and hadn't sung so much in years. This was fairly typical of many of the compliments given. Plus the "austerity" type of food and vintage drinks all added to the enjoyment.<br><br>One of the highlights for me was seeing one of our retired vicars dancing with a young lady from the cast!<br><br>Please pass on our thanks to Les and Tim. They worked so hard to give us a great show.<br><br>Best wishes,</p>

								<p>Great set at Corn Exchange tonight! I loved the whole feel of the excerpt. Very strong clear lead vocals. Good overall 1940's feel similar to Blitz or vackees! I was impressed with the high quality backing tracks too! As I am part of the band Timescape who specialise in the 1940's period music, I felt you got the whole era just right!</p>

								<p>My son, Perry, has Down Syndrome. He has been a member of the Lavender Hill Mob Theatre Company for many years. Before he joined, he was very shy and his speech was limited. Now, he is doing speaking parts in the shows. He has also learned many songs and dances; he is quite a celebrity in Hunstanton! He is often stopped and told by people how much they enjoyed watching him in the shows. He may not often be seen, but is definitely heard!<br><br>He is also very popular with the other members of the LHMTC and has many friends because of the LHMTC. Perry is also a member of the LHMTC Youth Forum and has his own page in the Newsletter and has taken many photos with his own camera to go on this page. Perry writes underneath each photo, the name of each animal or person he has taken, so his writing has improved greatly compared to what it was.<br><br>He tries so hard, so everyone can understand what he has written. He has now become a young man with lots of confidence and purpose. Without the Lavender Hill Mob Theatre Company, Perry would be lost; it has changed his life completely. He is now part of a group and not somebody different.</p>

								<p>Tom has been a part of the Lavender Hill Mob Theatre Company for the past year and attends three nights a week. Tom has now been given the opportunity to make friends outside of his daily routine and really enjoys the social interaction with members of all ages.<br><br>Being part of the company has enabled Tom to improve his confidence, listening skills, self-discipline and consideration to others in a safe environment. Tom particularly enjoys the dance session, which helps with his general fitness and co-ordination while having lots of fun. Tom really enjoys the buzz of being in the productions and takes a pride in the group's achievements.<br><br>Discovering the Lavender Hill Mob Theatre Company has been a godsend for Tom and the whole family as it also gives parents a chance to chat and share experiences and information in an accepting and non-judgemental atmosphere.</p>

								<p>I felt compelled to write to you and let you know how much myself and my mum enjoyed the recent show from LHM. It was fantastic!!! I also would like to express my gratitude and support. LHM are one of the best groups around they are inclusive, supportive and all round fantastic!! I was introduced by one of my service users and I have never been to a show which is so much fun and seen that the people performing are also having so much fun. I have passed out many flyers for the LHM's new group and I hope that you grow even more as a group and are able to support more people to join in on what looks like excellent fun. If I was a bit braver I think that even I would join!! Although I think that it would not be the best experience for everyone else!! I suppose what I am trying to say is that you do an excellent job and I am so impressed and proud of the group and the people in it!!! Thank you for the work that you do!</p>

								<p>The Royal British Legion 90th Anniversary Concert at Norwich Cathedral, last night - 8th October '11. Your act was fantastic - especially 'We are the Ovaltineys'. It took me back to 1934 Radio Luxembourg. My Granddaughter was in the Gresham Choir and they were also fantastic, as were The Band &amp; Bugles of the Rifles and of course 'Blake'. A most enjoyable evening.</p>
